# CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM-IRIS-DATASET
This is a clustering algorithm ml model for Iris data set Objective The objective of this assessment is to evaluate clustering techniques on the Iris dataset using KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering methods. The analysis involved preprocessing, applying clustering algorithms, visualizing clusters, and evaluating their performance using the silhouette score.

Loading and Preprocessing The Iris dataset was loaded from the sklearn library. The species column was dropped since clustering is an unsupervised learning problem. Feature scaling was performed using the MinMaxScaler to ensure all features were on a uniform scale, enhancing clustering performance.

Clustering Algorithm Implementation A) KMeans Clustering Description: KMeans clustering partitions the dataset into a specified number of clusters (k). It works iteratively by:

Randomly initializing k centroids. Assigning data points to the nearest centroid. Updating the centroids based on the mean of assigned points. This process continues until the centroids stabilize or a maximum iteration is reached. Why Suitable for Iris Dataset: The Iris dataset has well-separated clusters, making KMeans a good fit for detecting distinct groups based on distance metrics.

Implementation & Visualization:

The optimal number of clusters (k=3) was determined using the elbow method, which minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares. A scatter plot was used to visualize the clusters based on feature pairs. The clusters formed by KMeans aligned well with the known species distribution.

B) Hierarchical Clustering Description: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure of nested clusters (a dendrogram) by:

Initially treating each data point as a cluster. Iteratively merging the closest clusters based on a linkage criterion (e.g., average or complete linkage). This approach is useful for visualizing hierarchical relationships among clusters. Why Suitable for Iris Dataset: The dataset's small size and clear separations make it ideal for hierarchical clustering, which provides insights into cluster hierarchy and relationships.

Implementation & Visualization:

Agglomerative clustering was performed with the number of clusters set to 3. A dendrogram was created to visualize the cluster hierarchy. Scatter plots showed distinct clusters similar to KMeans results.

Evaluation The silhouette score was used to evaluate clustering performance. It measures how similar data points are within their own cluster compared to other clusters. Both KMeans and Hierarchical clustering achieved a silhouette score of 0.7814, indicating strong and well-separated clusters.
Conclusion Both clustering methods effectively identified the natural grouping in the Iris dataset. The consistent silhouette score of 0.7814 suggests that both algorithms performed equally well, capturing the intrinsic structure of the data.

KMeans Clustering: Computationally efficient and straightforward, making it ideal for this dataset. Hierarchical Clustering: Provided additional insights into the relationships between clusters through the dendrogram. For future applications, KMeans is recommended for larger datasets due to its scalability, while hierarchical clustering is suitable for small datasets where cluster hierarchy is of interest.
